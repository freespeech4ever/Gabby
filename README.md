# Gabby

Gabby is a beautiful Android client for any ActivityPub instance. ActivityPub/Mastodon/etc are a GNU social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.

Download the APK from [dissenter.com](https://dissenter.com/download)

## Features

- Material Design
- Most Mastodon APIs implemented
- Multi-Account support
- Dark, light and black themes with the possibility to auto-switch based on the time of day
- Drafts - compose toots and save them for later
- Choose between different emoji styles 
- Optimized for all screen sizes
- Completely open-source - no non-free dependencies like Google services

### Development history

Gabby is a fork of [Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky), in response to Tusky adding a blacklist of instances their future versions will refuse to connect to (and mock the user by rick-rolling them.)  Open source always wins.
